## Garnet Framework

**Garnet replaces the Smart Territory Framework.**

Garnet is an open-source framework for building scalable, reliable and interoperable platforms leveraging open standards, FIWARE open source technology and AWS Cloud services.

It supports the development and integration of smart and efficient solutions across multiple domains such as Smart Cities, Regions and Campuses, Energy and Utilities, Agriculture, Smart Building and Manufacturing.

Garnet facilitates the creation and connection of smart solutions. It helps you avoid vendor lock-in and break silos. It makes it easier to bring data together into one single space from heterogeneous sources, both internal and external, and extract insights from it.

Using Garnet, you can easily integrate existing solutions and add new capabilities and modules over time.
